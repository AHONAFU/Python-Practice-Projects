Simple python projects you can try. I made these when I was learning python back in 2021. The projects include,

1. Area Calculator
2. Districts of Bangladesh guessing game
3. binary search algorithm
4. adventure game (this is my fav one)
5. gui calculator
6. clock timer
7. day finder
8. find fibonacci
9. guess number
10. leap it
11. password generator
12. rock paper scissor
13. spin a yarn
14. tic tac toe

Please pardon the mistakes as these were done when I was at a very young age.
